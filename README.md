Project Description- A typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the chatbot passes the question to the customer representative. In this project, there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass the question onto Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owner’s manual.  To take it a step further, the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owner’s manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
